## About Me

In my darkest hour, AI lit the way—showing me how once-impossible ideas could take shape, and revealing its greatest power: helping us make better decisions amid complexity and uncertainty.That moment changed how I see the world—and what I believe AI should really be about.

To realize that vision, reliability must come first. My initial focus is addressing hallucinations—those moments when AI speaks with confidence but delivers falsehoods. I’m working on tools that help people make smarter decisions—in law, finance, and other fields where mistakes can be costly.My long-term goal is far more ambitious: I want AI to move beyond linear generation—to reason, adapt, and connect ideas across complex contexts, until it can truly think, not just generate.

If each of us has one mission in life, then mine is clear: to devote my life to building the future of AI.
