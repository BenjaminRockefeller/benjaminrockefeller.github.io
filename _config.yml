description: >
  I’m an LLM systems researcher and engineer focused on making language models usable, reliable, and scalable in the real world. 
  At NTU Singapore, I’ve led RAG pipelines, voice-interactive agents, causality-driven generators, and low-latency inference infrastructure—built for reasoning, adaptation, and deployment. 
  My edge is the fusion of deep model expertise and product strategy—translating intelligence into impact.
